        <!-- German Chocolate Cake -->

        <p>
            I have long associated German Chocolate Cake with Father's Day, although I'm not entirely sure why I think I remember my mom making it for my dad once or twice growing up(although never on Father's Day , ironically) and the correlation must have stuck
            somewhere along the way

            Are you a box mix german chocolate cake person? Or a from-scratch german chocolate cake person?
        </p>
        <p>Truth be told, it's REALLY hard to replicate that always-moist-and-fluffy texture that everyone loves about a box cake mix, but at the same time, we also love homemade, right?!</p>
        <p>It took me a LONG time to find a homemade german chocolate cake that I really, really loved Bax cake mixes seem to always bake up perfectly fluffy and moist german chocolate cakes, and the ones I've had rom bakenies have been great as well but
            I just couldn't seem to replicate it at home no manter how many recipes I tried. (Consequently, I haven't had the same issue with chocolate cakes! See: Seackers Cake-the base recipe for all of my chocolate cakes!)</p>
        <p>Mary were too dense, too dry, too chiffon-like, too fussy in their preparation I just wanted a fantastic german chocolate cake recipe I could use for buthday cakes that was easy to make and narned out delicioos Iceme across this recipe from Joy
            while I was on the hunt for vet another recipe to test out for Joseph's birthday</p>
        <p>This was IT The recipe that had eluded me for years!</p>
        <img src="./images/german-chocolate-cake1.jfif" alt="german-chocolate-cake1">
        <p>I love that this can easily be mixed together in one bowl using my hand mixer, there's nothing fussy about the ingredients or preparation, and it produces an absolutely perfect german chocolate cake The layers are light but sturdy, buttery and
            moist, and the ideal base for your very favorite chocolate frosting</p>
        <p>I used the chocolate frosting recipe from my ultimate chocolate cupcakes, and it was a wonderful companion to this cake The frosting is more buttery than sugary, satiny smooth and full of rich chocolate flavor It glides on like a dream!</p>

        <p>german chocolate cake tends to be the elusive unicorn of homemade baking; so many cakes can turn out too dry, too crumbly, too dense, too cornbread-like, and I have one major piece of advice for ensuring german chocolate cake perfection:</p>
        <h3>Make sure all of the ingredients listed "at room temperature" ARE ACTUALLY AT ROOM TEMPERATURE.</h3>
        <p> I've totally been there and have used still-cool butter, eggs or dairy in a recipe when I'm in a hurry, but it's actually vitally important here. Having all of those ingredients at room temperature ensures that they emulsify, which traps air in
            the batter and, once in the oven, that air expands and produces a fluffy cake.</p>
        <p>Room temperature ingredients also ensure that the batter comes together well and is ultra-smooth, which keeps the resulting cake from being crumbly or combread-like</p>
